<h1>A basic HTML template</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my long and wonderful journey into JavaScript programming and mapping.</p>
    
    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    
    <p>As a GIS professional and a lifelong geography lover, I have spent much of my career admiring and creating maps. I feel (and hope) that I exhibit some qualities of the all three personas: cartographer, coder, and critic. As a cartographer (who presented a map at NACIS!), I aim to follow cartographic principles and am really proud when I can produce a "beautiful map". As a coder, I am often excited to try out new mapping tools and advocate using technology to automate some mundane, repetitive task. As a critic, I love to point out the flaws of other people's maps and have reported feedback to Google Maps on many occasions.</p>
    
    <p>Of the three personas which represent design, technology, and critical analysis, I recognize the importance of all of them, but feel the most connected to the cartographer persona. If a map is hideous, I find it hard – or even impossible – to use. I didn't buy a navigation system for my car because I thought the map design was too ugly. I still struggle with the road symbology in Bing Maps and OpenStreetMap. While I have definitely made my fair share of ugly maps (which the client likes and uses), it is most rewarding to make a beautiful map. In this course and throughout my career, I hope to learn enough cartographic theory, technology, and critical analysis skills to be able to make beautiful maps that effectively deliver their message.</p>
    
    <p>While reading the essay, I was most moved by the concept of prioritization. Every map represents someone's view of what is important. It is impossible for everything to be equally prioritized, so important items are prominently displayed, while less important items are subdued or omitted entirely. Maps have come so far from the hard-copy globes and encyclopedias I studied as a kid. Google Maps completely revolutionized the mapping industry. In the current interface, features are displayed on the map based on what you have previously searched for. You can add missing features and correct ones that are wrong. It is quite possibly the most personalized and customizable web map ever created, but even Google cannot show everything with equal priority. The features most important to your world -- your Jerusalem -- are displayed, while other features are hidden. Perhaps that is what makes a map so powerful: something is always out there to be discovered.</p>
